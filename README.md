> ### Purpose/Motivation
> We need a way to differentiate a tier based on it's plan. This is an evolving tier so this is the first pass at this.
> 
> ### What does this PR do?
> - Add tier service + test w/ barebones differentiation of plans based on their tiers
> - Add resolvers + test to expose that to the client

> ### Legal Boilerplate
> 
> Look, I get it. The _entity doing business as "Sentry" was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015 as Functional Software_, Inc. In 2022 this entity acquired Codecov and as result Sentry is going to need some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in this PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate intact I confirm that Sentry can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my contributions, under Sentry's choice of terms.
